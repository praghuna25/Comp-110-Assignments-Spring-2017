Here is my content!

```{r}
download.file("http://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda", 
              dest="Library-small.rda")
```

The data was downloaded from a link provided by Professor Kaplan. It contains library book data from Macalester College.

## Basics

Loading the data:

```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")
```
```{r}
head(Inv)
names(Inv)
```

Dimensions of the dataset

```{r}
dim(Inv)
```

Looking at the dataset Bks :

```{r}
head(Bks)
names(Bks)
dim(Bks)
```

The dataset Inv contains 2000 entries/ cases which seem to be books and each case has 18 parameters. Similarly, the dataset Bks contains 3765 entries with 15 parameters for each entry.



```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```
